	// Templates, can I do it for linked lists? To allow arbitrary

	// Should I look at the linked list questions again to think about

	// I need to think more about if I can pass an object like a linked list
	// as an output of a function. Can I make a linked list in a function and 
	// have it accesible outside. Copy constructors? They might be needed. The 
	// new operator allows it to persist outside the function:
	//
	// Look into std::unique pointer.

	// Investigate stack objects, I guess it is similar to linked list.
	//
	// Difference between stack and heap.

	// Revise makefiles.
